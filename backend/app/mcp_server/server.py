"""MCP stdio server for Clew.

Wires four read-only tools over the user's local Clew workspace so that
any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, ...) can see their
graphs, current learning progress, and note contents.

The server loads the workspace from the same SQLite database the Clew
backend uses (``knowledge_graph.sqlite3``). The database path is resolved
from the existing backend settings (``KG_DB_PATH`` / ``DB_PATH``), so no
extra configuration is required when running alongside the regular backend.

Clew holds the user's learning graphs. Nodes are study topics with a \
progress state (not_started, learning, shaky, needs_review, solid, \
mastered). Edges describe relationships between topics, with the \
``requires`` relation representing prerequisites. The user can have \
several graphs (for example one per subject), and exactly one of them is \
active at a time.

Call ``get_current_learning_context`` before answering questions that \
touch what the user is studying so that your reply reflects their \
in-progress topics and any topics blocked by open prerequisites. Use \
``search_notes`` to find a node by keyword, then ``get_node`` for the \
full description, resources, and neighbors. Call ``list_graphs`` only \
when the user mentions a graph you have not seen yet.\
